- Integration coverage for module dependency wiring and feed queue database contracts
- CI installation, unit, integration, coding-standard, and dependency-injection compilation checks across supported Magento Open Source and Mage-OS releases
- Private vulnerability reporting policy

### Fixed

- Removed the duplicated Google Shopping `shipping_weight` default column
- Added the required encoding to the Local Inventory feed definition
- Replaced legacy DoubleClick remarketing pixels and globals with Google tag events
- Made configurable deep links work independently of the dynamic remarketing setting
- Added support for configurable dropdown deep links as well as swatches
- Updated Promotions enums and repeated destinations for Shopping ads and free listings
- Updated schema.org offer URLs to HTTPS
- Corrected cached uploader reuse so each FTP or SFTP destination uses its own credentials
- Applied the saved gzip setting to product and Promotions uploads with cleanup after transfer
- Fixed post-upload event data so Promotions uploads receive the destination object instead of a Boolean result
- Removed the original paid-module product skip attribute from the new module's runtime behavior
- Excluded historical data patches that could inspect or move legacy-package data and log files
- Fixed PHP 8 failures in filter sorting, empty delimiter handling, generator state restoration, and additional image mapping
- Hardened price formatting against nonnumeric strings and restored label mapping for array-valued select attributes
- Passed modern configurable-product dependencies explicitly to avoid runtime service-locator fallbacks
- Replaced the service-locator serializer wrapper with Magento's serializer interface
- Made stock handling safe when no legacy stock item is returned and avoided duplicate stock-status reads
- Made empty-column replacement and option concatenation safe for incomplete configuration data
- Corrected log-handler replacement so stale handlers are not retained
- Restricted feed, Promotions, and log output to approved Magento directories and safe file extensions
- Added explicit Admin ACL resources and POST-only contracts for feed mutations
- Protected grid AJAX and export data sources with the feed-view ACL
- Made manual and scheduled queue creation share the queue model's persistence invariants
- Made required feed and queue database fields safe for new manual queue entries
- Secured Google taxonomy downloads with HTTPS, locale validation, response-status checks, and deterministic connection cleanup
- Guaranteed cron generation locks are released and closed after all PHP failures
- Made the generation CLI return a failure exit code when queue processing fails
- Made the shared Promotions cache hash-aware and atomically replaceable across concurrent feed processes

### Migration

- No automatic migration from the Rocket Web packages is performed
- Existing package installations and data remain untouched

### Changed

- Aligned Composer metadata, source notices, and the bundled license on OSL-3.0
